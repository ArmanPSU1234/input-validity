//  Purpose: Using single branched ifs to check validity of input.
//  a program that will calculate total savings by a student with his/her parents’ contribution.
//  The student’s parents have agreed to add to the student’s savings based the percentage the student saved using the schedule given below.
//          student percent       parents’ percentage
//              <5%                     1.0%
//      >=  5%  but < 10%               2.5%
//      >= 10%  but < 15%               8.0%
//      >= 15%  but < 25%            	12.5%
//      >= 25%  but < 35%            	15.0%
//           >= 35%                     20.0%
//
//  For example if the student earned $1500 and saved $150 (10%),
//  the parents would contribute $120 (8%) for a total of saving of $270.00
